## Description

This is a node app that will automatically make a simple SVG type logo using javascript. This was created to make simple logos for future websites as placeholders. When making this project, my biggest challenge was figuring out how to use exported classes. I got frequent error messages where the Shape class was improperly exported. This problem got fixed by changing the variables to this.shape, this.txt, this.txtColor, etc.
